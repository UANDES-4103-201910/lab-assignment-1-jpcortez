3.- The studied page is divided in 2 structures. The first one is the Head section. It can be identified with "<HEAD>" at the start, and finishes with a "</HEAD>". Here is the information aboout the document. Generally, it's not seen by the user. The most important element is the "<TITLE>", that shows in the top of the window the name of the page. Another component is the <meta> tag, that has a "name" and "content". In the "name" attribute, you can put a description or keyword, and in "content" put the content. For example: <meta name="author" content="Jorge Cortez">.  

Then, there is the "<BODY>" section that contains all the information that the user will see when he loads the webpage. It supports text, Hyper-links, images, Special characters, list, tables, frames, etc. The <center> section is the place where the information will be shown. In the page studied, there are 2 tables. One for the top orange area, and other for the body.  

4.- In the "(index)" the is the code from the "Elements" tab. The .js have all the functions that the page will use. Then, the css allows to edite the format of the page, like images, font, colors, margins and other sthetic elements. Finally, the .gif are the images used.
